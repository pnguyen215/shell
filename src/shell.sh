# shell::version function
# This function outputs the current version of the shell library.

# shell::upgrade function
# This function upgrades the shell library by removing the existing installation

#
# Usage:
#   shell::upgrade
#
# Description:
#   - Displays a message indicating the upgrade process has started.
#   - Sets the installation directory to $HOME/shell.
#   - Removes the existing installation directory if it exists.
#   - Downloads and executes the install script from the GitHub repository.
#   - Informs the user that the shell has been upgraded and provides instructions
#     to restart the terminal or source the appropriate shell configuration file.
#
#   It checks for the presence of the source command in the user's .zshrc or .bashrc
#   files and executes the appropriate command to ensure the new version is loaded.

# shell::uninstall function
# This function uninstalls the shell library by removing the installation directory
# and informing the user about the uninstallation process.
#
# Usage:
#   shell::uninstall
#
# Description:
#   - Displays a message indicating that the uninstallation process has started.
#   - Sets the installation directory to $HOME/shell.
#   - Checks if the installation directory exists; if it does, it removes it.
#   - Informs the user that the shell has been uninstalled and provides instructions
#     to manually remove the source command from their shell configuration file
#     (e.g., ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc).
