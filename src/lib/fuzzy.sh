# fzf_copy function
# Interactively selects a file to copy and a destination directory using fzf,
# then copies the selected file to the destination directory.
#
# Usage:
#   fzf_copy
#
# Description:
#   This function leverages fzf to provide an interactive interface for choosing:
#     1. A source file (from the current directory and subdirectories).
#     2. A destination directory (from the current directory and subdirectories).
#   It then copies the source file to the destination directory using the original filename.
#
# Example:
#   fzf_copy
#
# Requirements:
#   - fzf must be installed.
#   - Helper functions: run_cmd_eval, colored_echo, and get_os_type.

# fzf_zip_attachment function
# Zips selected files from a specified folder and outputs the absolute path of the created zip file.
#
# Usage:
#   fzf_zip_attachment [-n] <folder_path>
#
# Parameters:
#   - -n          : Optional dry-run flag. If provided, the command is printed using on_evict instead of executed.
#   - <folder_path>: The folder (directory) from which to select files for zipping.
#
# Description:
#   This function uses the 'find' command to list all files in the specified folder,
#   and then launches 'fzf' in multi-select mode to allow interactive file selection.
#   If one or more files are selected, a zip command is constructed to compress those files.
#   In dry-run mode (-n), the command is printed (via on_evict) without execution;
#   otherwise, it is executed using run_cmd_eval.
#   Finally, the absolute path of the created zip file is echoed.
#
# Example:
#   fzf_zip_attachment /path/to/folder
#   fzf_zip_attachment -n /path/to/folder  # Dry-run: prints the command without executing it.

# fzf_current_zip_attachment function
# Reuses fzf_zip_attachment to zip selected files from the current directory,
# then renames the resulting zip file to use the current directory's basename and places it inside the current directory.
#
# Usage:
#   fzf_current_zip_attachment [-n]
#
# Parameters:
#   - -n         : Optional dry-run flag. If provided, the command is printed using on_evict instead of executed.
#
# Description:
#   The function sets the folder to the current working directory and computes the desired zip filename as "<basename_of_pwd>.zip" in the current directory.
#   It then calls fzf_zip_attachment with the current directory.
#   If not in dry-run mode, after zipping, the function renames the generated zip file from "<PWD>.zip" to "<PWD>/<basename_of_pwd>.zip".
#   Finally, it echoes the absolute path of the renamed zip file.
