# Installs Homebrew using the official installation script.
#
# Usage:
#   shell::install_homebrew

#   script via curl. The command is executed using shell::run_cmd_eval, which logs
#   the command before executing it.
#
# Dependencies:

#
# Example:
#   shell::install_homebrew
shell::install_homebrew() {
    # Check for the help flag (-h)
    if [ "$1" = "-h" ]; then

# shell::removal_homebrew function
# Uninstalls Homebrew from the system.
#
# Usage:
#   shell::removal_homebrew
#
# Description:
#   This function first checks if Homebrew is installed using shell::is_command_available.
#   If Homebrew is detected, it uninstalls Homebrew by running the official uninstall
#   script. Additionally, it removes Homebrew-related lines from the user's shell
#   profile (e.g., $HOME/.zprofile) using sed. The commands are executed via
#   shell::run_cmd_eval to ensure they are logged prior to execution.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - shell::is_command_available: Checks if the 'brew' command is available in the PATH.
#   - shell::run_cmd_eval: Executes shell commands with logging.
#   - shell::colored_echo: Displays colored messages to the terminal.
#
# Example:
#   shell::removal_homebrew
shell::removal_homebrew() {
    # Check for the help flag (-h)
    if [ "$1" = "-h" ]; then
        echo "$USAGE_SHELL_REMOVAL_HOMEBREW"
        return 0
